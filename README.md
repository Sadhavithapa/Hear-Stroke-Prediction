# Hear-Stroke-Prediction
Heart stroke prediction using K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.


Heart stroke is the primary cause of death now-a-days. Treatments of heart disease patients have been advanced, for example with Machine-To-Machine (M2M) technology to enable remote patient monitoring. M2M is used to take care of a remote heart disease patient, medical condition should be measured periodically at home. Thus, it is difficult to perform complex tests which need physicians to help. Meanwhile, heart stroke can be predicted by analyzing some of the patient's health parameters. With the help of data mining techniques, heart stroke prediction can be improved. In this project improved k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used. The experimental results show that the proposed KNN algorithm gives better results than the existing system in terms of accuracy.
